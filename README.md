Palindromes Overview
====================

This simple java program is meant as a class exercise in both java and git.
It implements four difrerent methods to test whether a string is a palindrome.

The method that I made was iterative and used the charAt() method.

Usage

Compile with: 'javac Palindrome.java'
Run with :'java Palindrome'
